# n8n.AI.Agnet

To run `n8n` locally on your machine, you’ll need to install it and set it up so it runs on your localhost. Below are the steps to achieve this using different methods, assuming you’re using a Windows machine (since you mentioned CMD earlier). These instructions will also work on macOS or Linux with slight adjustments.

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 16 or higher recommended). Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and install it if you haven’t already.
2. **npm**: This comes with Node.js and is used to install `n8n`.
3. **Command Prompt or Terminal**: You’ll use CMD (Windows) or a terminal (macOS/Linux) to run commands.

## n8n
This is the simplest way to get `n8n` running locally.

1. **Install n8n globally**:
   Open CMD (or your terminal) and run:
   ```
   npm install -g n8n
   ```
   This installs `n8n` globally, making the `n8n` command available everywhere.

2. **Start n8n**:
   Once installed, run:
   ```
   n8n start
   ```
   This launches `n8n` locally. By default, it runs on `http://localhost:5678`.

3. **Access n8n**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5678`. You should see the `n8n` workflow editor.

## ngrok 

To set up `ngrok` with `n8n` running locally, you’ll need to expose your local `n8n` instance to the internet so it can receive webhooks or be accessed externally. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

---

### Step 1: Install ngrok
1. **Download ngrok**:
   - Go to the [ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the binary for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Extract the `ngrok` executable to a folder (e.g., `C:\ngrok` on Windows or `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS).

2. **Authenticate ngrok**:
   - Sign in to your ngrok dashboard and copy your authtoken.
   - Open CMD (Windows) or a terminal (macOS/Linux) and run:
     ```
     ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
     ```
     Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the token from your dashboard. This saves the token to a config file (e.g., `~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml` on Linux/macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\.ngrok2\ngrok.yml` on Windows).

### Step 2: Run n8n Locally
Choose one of these methods based on how you installed `n8n`:

#### Option 1: Via npm
1. If not installed, install `n8n` globally:
   ```
   npm install -g n8n
   ```
2. Start `n8n`:
   ```
   n8n start
   ```
   - It will run on `http://localhost:5678` by default.
   - Verify it’s working by opening `http://localhost:5678` in your browser.

### Step 3: Expose n8n with ngrok
1. **Start an ngrok tunnel**:
   In a new CMD or terminal window, run:
   ```
   ngrok http 5678
   ```
   - This creates a public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) that tunnels to `http://localhost:5678`.

2. **Check the ngrok output**:
   You’ll see something like:
   ```
   Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> localhost:5678
   ```
   - Copy the `https://abc123.ngrok.io` URL. This is your public `n8n` address.

3. **Test the URL**:
   - Open the `https://abc123.ngrok.io` URL in your browser. You should see the `n8n` interface.

---

### Step 4: Configure n8n to Use the ngrok URL
For webhooks to work correctly, `n8n` needs to know its external URL. Set the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable:

#### Option 1: npm
1. Stop `n8n` if it’s running (`Ctrl + C`).
2. Start `n8n` with the ngrok URL:
   - On Windows (CMD):
     ```
     set WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io && n8n
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io n8n
     ```
   Replace `https://abc123.ngrok.io` with your ngrok URL.

3. Verify:
   - In the `n8n` UI, create a webhook node and check that the URL starts with your ngrok address (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/...`).
